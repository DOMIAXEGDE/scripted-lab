# Scripted Lab

A minimal execution environment for structured programming experiments.  
The system is **Turing complete and safe**, designed to encourage thoughtful computation.

> **Tagline:** *Think first, compute later.*

## Features
- JSON-based stdin/stdout execution model
- Deterministic and reproducible program flow
- Cross-language extensibility (C++, Qt, Java examples)
- Safe by design: speed constraints encourage deliberate programming

## Philosophy
Scripted Lab isn’t about raw performance — it’s about **clarity, safety, and intentionality**.  
By slowing down execution and requiring explicit reasoning, users naturally focus on **what they are doing and why they are doing it**.
